# DSA Solutions by Teja Nayani

Welcome to my personal repository of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** solutions written in **Java**.  
This repo is part of my focused journey to crack Full Stack Developer interviews by the end of 2025. üöÄ

Each solution is written with clean, readable code and contains categories like Arrays, Strings, Hashing, and more.

---

## Folder Structure

Each topic has its own folder for clarity:

- `Arrays/` ‚Üí Problems related to array manipulation
- `Strings/` ‚Üí Problems involving string operations
- (More coming soon: LinkedLists, Recursion, HashMaps, Trees, etc.)

---

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Java  
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code  
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub  

---

## My Goal

To master DSA fundamentals and enhance coding fluency for SDE roles by **September‚ÄìNovember 2025**.  
I‚Äôll keep updating this repo with more optimized solutions and advanced topics.

## Problems Included

| üóÇ Category | üìÑ File | üîç Description |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| Arrays     | `ContainsDuplicate.java` | Checks if an array contains any duplicate element |
| Arrays     | `FindDuplicatesInArray.java` | Finds all duplicate numbers in an array |
| Arrays     | `LongestConsecutiveSequence.java` | Finds the length of the longest sequence of consecutive integers using a `HashSet` (O(n)). |
| Arrays | `BestTimeToBuyAndSellStock.java` | Calculates the maximum profit from a single buy-sell transaction by tracking the lowest price and maximum gain so far. |
| Arrays     | `TwoSum.java` | Returns indices of two numbers that sum to a target (hash map, O(n)) |
| Arrays     | `TwoSumII.java` | Returns indices (1-based) of two numbers in sorted array that sum to a target using two pointers. |
| Arrays     | `ThreeSum.java` | Finds all unique triplets that sum to 0 using sorting + two pointers, with duplicate skips. |
| Arrays | `FourSum.java` | Finds all unique quadruplets that sum to a given target using two nested loops + two pointers, with early pruning and duplicate handling. |
| Arrays      | `ProductOfArrayExceptSelf.java` | For each index, returns product of all other elements without division (prefix/suffix products, O(n) time, O(1) extra space). |
| Arrays      | `TopKFrequentElements.java`     | Finds the k most frequent elements (bucket sort O(n) or min-heap O(n log k)). |
| Arrays | `ValidSudoku.java` | Checks if a given 9√ó9 Sudoku board is valid using row/column/box tracking (boolean arrays). |
| Arrays | `MergeSortedArray.java` | Merges two sorted arrays in-place using 3-pointer technique (from end), avoiding extra space. |
| Arrays | `IntersectionOfTwoArraysII.java` | Finds intersection of two arrays (with duplicates) using frequency array optimized based on smaller input. |
| Arrays | `MoveZeroes.java` | Moves all zeros to the end while preserving order of non-zero elements using zero count shift method. |
| Arrays | `MajorityElement.java` | Uses Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm to find the element appearing more than n/2 times. |
| Arrays | `RemoveElement.java` | Removes all instances of a given value from the array in-place and returns the new valid length. |
| Arrays | `PlusOne.java` | Adds one to a number represented as an array of digits, handling carry and overflow cases. |
| Arrays | `AddBinary.java` | Adds two binary strings using two-pointer and carry logic, returns result as binary string. |
| Greedy | `BestTimeToBuyAndSellStockII.java` | Maximizes profit by summing all increasing consecutive pairs (greedy approach). |
| Strings | `CountPalindromicSubstrings.java` | Counts all palindromic substrings using center expansion method (odd and even length). |
| Strings | `LongestSubstringWithoutRepeatingChars.java` | Uses sliding window with last seen character map to find longest substring without repeating characters. |
| Strings     | `ValidAnagram.java`             | Checks if two strings are anagrams (frequency count using hash map / count array; O(n) time). |
| Strings     | `GroupAnagrams.java`            | Groups words that are anagrams using a hash map keyed by sorted string or char-count string key. |
| Strings     | `ReverseString.java` | Reverses the given string (character array) in-place |
| Strings    | `ValidPalindrome  .java` | Validates if a string is a valid palindrome (ignores cases, symbols) |
| Strings    | `FirstNonRepeatingCharacter.java` | Finds the index of the first non-repeating character |
| Strings    | `EncodeDecodeStrings.java` | Encodes a list of strings into one string and decodes it back (used for data transmission). |
