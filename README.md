# DSA Solutions by Teja Nayani

Welcome to my personal repository of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** solutions written in **Java**.  
This repo is part of my focused journey to crack Full Stack Developer interviews by the end of 2025. 🚀

Each solution is written with clean, readable code and contains categories like Arrays, Strings, Hashing, and more.

---

## Folder Structure

Each topic has its own folder for clarity:

- `Arrays/` → Problems related to array manipulation
- `Strings/` → Problems involving string operations
- (More coming soon: LinkedLists, Recursion, HashMaps, Trees, etc.)

## Sample Problems

| 🗂 Category | 📄 File | 🔍 Description |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| Arrays     | `ContainsDuplicate.java` | Checks if an array contains any duplicate element |
| Arrays     | `FindDuplicatesInArray.java` | Finds all duplicate numbers in an array |
| Arrays     | `TwoSum.java` | Returns indices of two numbers that sum to a target (hash map, O(n)) |
| Arrays      | `ProductOfArrayExceptSelf.java` | For each index, returns product of all other elements without division (prefix/suffix products, O(n) time, O(1) extra space). |
| Arrays      | `TopKFrequentElements.java`     | Finds the k most frequent elements (bucket sort O(n) or min-heap O(n log k)). |
| Strings     | `ValidAnagram.java`             | Checks if two strings are anagrams (frequency count using hash map / count array; O(n) time). |
| Strings     | `GroupAnagrams.java`            | Groups words that are anagrams using a hash map keyed by sorted string or char-count string key. |
| Strings     | `ReverseString.java` | Reverses the given string (character array) in-place |
| Strings    | `ValidPalindrome  .java` | Validates if a string is a valid palindrome (ignores cases, symbols) |
| Strings    | `FirstNonRepeatingCharacter.java` | Finds the index of the first non-repeating character |

## My Goal

To master DSA fundamentals and enhance coding fluency for Java Full Stack Development roles by **September–November 2025**.  
I’ll keep updating this repo with more optimized solutions and advanced topics.
