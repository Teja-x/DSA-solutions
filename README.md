# DSA Solutions by Teja Nayani

Welcome to my personal repository of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** solutions written in **Java**.  
This repo is part of my focused journey to crack Full Stack Developer interviews by the end of 2025. üöÄ

Each solution is written with clean, readable code and contains categories like Arrays, Strings, Hashing, and more.

---

## Folder Structure

Each topic has its own folder for clarity:

- `Arrays/` ‚Üí Problems related to array manipulation
- `Strings/` ‚Üí Problems involving string operations
- (More coming soon: LinkedLists, Recursion, HashMaps, Trees, etc.)

---

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Java  
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code  
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub  

---

## My Goal

To master DSA fundamentals and enhance coding fluency for SDE roles by **September‚ÄìNovember 2025**.  
I‚Äôll keep updating this repo with more optimized solutions and advanced topics.
